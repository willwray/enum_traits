```C++
  ltl::is_scoped_enum<T>;   // Test if type T is a scoped enum (lazy).
  ltl::is_scoped_enum_v<T>; // Test if type T is a scoped enum (eager).

  ltl::is_fixed_enum<T>;    // Test if type T is a 'fixed' enum,
  ltl::is_fixed_enum_v<T>;  // i.e. an enum  with fixed underlying type.

  ltl::underlying_type<T>;  // c++17 port of c++20's improved UB-free
                            // 'SFINAE-friendly' std::underlying_type.

  ltl::to_underlying(e);    // Convenience cast to underlying type P1682.
